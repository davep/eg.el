# eg.el

A Norton Guide reader for GNU Emacs.

## Commentary:

`eg.el` provides code for reading the content
of
[help databases built with Norton Guide and Expert Help](http://www.davep.org/norton-guides/file-format/).
It also provides commands for viewing and navigating the content of Norton
Guide files.

If you don't know what a Norton Guide is, you probably don't have a need to
know. If you do, this code might come in handy if you're in that strange
position of being someone who wants to or needs to read NG files *and* you
are an avid Emacs user.

Here's a little sample of `eg.el` in action in a text terminal:
